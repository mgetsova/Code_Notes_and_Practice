'''
Square Brackets [] - represent a character class consisting of a set of characters that we wish to match. For example, the character class [abc] will match any single a, b, or c. 
We can also specify a range of characters using â€“ inside the square brackets. For example, 

[0, 3] is sample as [0123]
[a-c] is same as [abc]
We can also invert the character class using the caret(^) symbol. For example, 

[^0-3] means any character except 0, 1, 2, or 3
[^a-c] means any character except a, b, or c

Or (|) - any one element separated by the | char

a|b will match any string that contains a or b such as acd, bcd, abcd, etc.
'''

'''
Question Mark (?) - preceeding char may or may not be present in the string to be matched

ab?c will be matched for the string ac, acb, dabc but will not be 
matched for abbc because there are two b. Similarly, it will not be matched 
for abdc because b is not followed by c.
'''

'''
Asterix (*) - match preceeding char or set of chars for 0 or more times

ab*c will be matched for the string ac, abc, abbbc, dabc, etc. but will not 
be matched for abdc because b is not followed by c.
'''

'''
Plus (+) - repeat preceeding character or set of characters at least 1 or more times
(up to inifnity)

ab+c will be matched for the string abc, abbc, dabc, but will not be matched for ac, abdc, 
because there is no b in ac and b, is not followed by c in abdc.
'''

'''
Curly Brackets {} - repeat preceeeding char or set of chars as many times as 
the value inside the bracket 

{2} - repeat 2x
{min,} - preceeding char matches/repeated min or more times
{min, max} - preceeding char repeated at least min or at most max times

a{2, 4} will be matched for the string aaab, baaaac, gaad, but will not be 
matched for strings like abc, bc because there is only one a or no a in both
the cases.
'''

'''
Parenthesis / Group () - used to group subpatterns 

(a|b)cd will match for strings like acd, abcd, gacd, etc.

# Speacial Sequences
'''
\A --- matches if string begins with given char --- \Afor matches "for geeks" "for the world"
\b --- matches if the word begins or ends with the given char, \bstring checks for begining of the word and string\b checks for the ending --- \bge matches "geeks" "get" 
\B --- opposite of \b, string should not start or end with the given regex --- \Bge matches "together" "forge"
\d --- matches any decimal digit, equivalent to the set class [0-9] --- \d matches "123" "gee1"
\D --- matches any non-digit char, this is equivalent to the set calss [^0-9] --- \D matches "geeks" "geek1"
\s --- matches any whitespace char --- \s matches "gee ks" "a bc a"
\S --- matches any non-whitespace char --- \S matches "a bd" "abcd"
\w --- matches any alphanumeric char, this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_] --- \w matches "123" "geeKs4"
\W --- matches any non-alphanumeric char --- \W matches ">$" "gee<>"
\Z --- matches if the string ends with the given regex --- ab\Z matches "abcdab" "abababab"
